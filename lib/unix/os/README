This file contains a list of all the operating systems that this library can support:

spoon - the spoon operating system
empty - A purely, empty OS. Useful if you just want the standard functions: strcpy, etc.



That's it. It's quite an exhaustive list.  Add your OS to this list and help improve the library.
