lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol
suite that has been developed by Adam Dunkels at the Computer and
Networks Architectures (CNA) lab at the Swedish Institute of Computer
Science (SICS).

The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce the RAM usage
while still having a full scale TCP. This making lwIP suitable for use
in embedded systems with tenths of kilobytes of free RAM and room for
around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.

lwIP features:
 * IP (Internet Protocol) including packet forwarding over multiple
   network interfaces
 * ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for network maintenance
   and debugging
 * UDP (User Datagram Protocol) including experimental UDP-lite
   extensions
 * TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) with congestion control, RTT
   estimation and fast recovery/fast retransmit
 * Specialized API for enhanced performance
 * Optional Berkeley socket API

lwIP is freely avaliable under a BSD-style license.
